# C# Assignment: Basic Constructs

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the use of primitive types, conditional statements, enums, structs, and loops in C#.

## Problem Statement
Create a simple C# console application that simulates a basic student grading system. The program should:

1. Define a `Student` struct to store student details.
2. Use an `enum` to represent letter grades (A, B, C, D, F).
3. Accept user input for a student's name and marks.
4. Determine the grade based on the marks using conditional statements.
5. Use a loop to allow input for multiple students.
6. Display the student's details along with their grade.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Understand and use primitive types in C#.
- Implement conditional statements for decision-making.
- Use `enum` and `struct` effectively.
- Utilize loops for handling multiple records.
- Develop a basic interactive console application in C#.

### Example Output
```
Enter number of students: 2

Enter student name: Alice
Enter marks: 85
Alice received grade: B

Enter student name: Bob
Enter marks: 92
Bob received grade: A
```

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
